# Be My Valentine? 💝

## The Story

It's 2026, and I wanted to ask my girlfriend to be my Valentine. But here's the thing. I'm a developer, and "normal" just isn't in my vocabulary.

So instead of a boring text message or a generic card, I did what any reasonable person would do: I built a whole website.

## The Catch

There are two buttons: **Yes** and **No**.

But here's where it gets fun:

- **On desktop**: The "No" button is... shy. It runs away from your cursor. Good luck clicking it.
- **On mobile**: Every time you tap "No", another "Yes" button appears. The screen fills up with Yes buttons. Resistance is futile.

Because let's be honest "No" was never really an option

## What Happens When She Says Yes

Hearts. Lots of hearts. An explosion of floating hearts and a celebration screen because that's exactly how I'll feel when she says yes.

## The Tech

Just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, Only pure love and code.

- Modern fonts via Google Fonts (Playfair Display + Poppins)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- A shy button that genuinely doesn't want to be clicked

## Running Locally

```bash
# Just open the file in your browser
open index.html

# Or use a simple server
npx serve .
```

## The Verdict

Did she say yes?

Well, you're reading this README, so clearly I had the confidence to make it public. Draw your own conclusions

_Built with mass love for her._
